# layout.js
- Layout.js contains components which are invariable to all the sub-routes in that route.
- Till now we were using layout.js of home page and using that in other routes. But if a route has other subroutes and we want a custom layout for other that page and its children we can define a custom layout for that route

Basic layout.js template
```jsx
import React from 'react'

const layout = ({children}) => {
  return (
    <div>
        <h1>Layout</h1>
        {children}
    </div>
  )
}

export default layout
```

# Conditional components & usePathname hook

```jsx
import { usePathname } from 'next/navigation'

const pathName = usePathname();
```

Use the above hook to create if-else in components to make them/or not render in particular routes
> It can only be used in client component
