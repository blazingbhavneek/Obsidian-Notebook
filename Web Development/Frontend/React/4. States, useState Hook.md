# Why we need states?
Look at the code below
App.js
```jsx
function App() {
  var age = 0;

  const increaseAge = () => {
    age = age+1;
    console.log(age);
  }
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {age}
      <button onClick={increaseAge} >Increase age</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Clicking the button should change the {age} in the JSX right? as its just a variable defined above, but NOOOO. It doesn't work like that, although the button is change the variable itself its not rendered by react in the JSX

Here's when states come in...
