# Terminology
In a component lifecycle
1. Mounting: When comp appears on screen
2. Updating: When some state changes in a component
3. Unmounting: When its removed from the screen

Now these stages of component lifecycle is used by useEffect hook


>Note: Running useEffect hook consoles the message twice if the app is running in strict as Strict mode renders twice to check if useEffect hooks are used properly

App.js
```jsx
	useEffect(()=>{
	    console.log("Component mounted!")
	})
```
Index.js:  
```jsx
	<React.StrictMode>
	    <App />
	</React.StrictMode>
```

## Why?
Simple example: Making a fetch request when a component is loaded on the screen, not beforehand

# useEffect Hook

task.js
```jsx
import {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

export const TaskComp = (props) => {
    let [done, setDone] = useState(props.done);
    const handleDone = () => {
        setDone(!done);
    }

    useEffect(()=>{
        console.log("Component mounted!!");
    });
    
    return (
        <div>
            <h2 style={{ color: done ? "green" : "red" }}>{props.name}</h2>
            <button onClick={handleDone}>Done</button>
            <button onClick={() => props.deleteFunc(props.id)}>Delete</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```
Everytime a new task is made it will print "Component mounted!!" in console, or something inside the task component is changed or its deleted
If you want to only use useEffect only when "done" status is changed (or some other state is updated) then add the variable name in the ==Dependancy Array==
```jsx
useEffect(()=>{
	console.log("Component mounted");
}, [done]);
```

How to do some other thing when component is unmounted??
```jsx
useEffect(()=>{
	console.log("Component mounted");

	return () => {
		console.log("Component Unmounted");
	}
}, [done]);
    
```
> Now you will observe that if you change the "done" status, the component will first unmount and then be mounted again
