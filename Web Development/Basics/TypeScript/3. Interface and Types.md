## Interface
```ts
interface User {
    name: string,
    email: string,
    age?: number // optional
}

function getUser(obj: User){
    console.log(obj.name);
}

getUser({name:"abc", email:"def"});
// abc

interface Admin extends User { // admin has properties of user as well
    admin: boolean
}

```
Interface is used to define shape of the object to pass through functions

## Types
```ts
type value = string | number | null;
```
Define custom type for variables

### Intersection
```ts
type User = {
    name: string,
    email: string
}

type Admin = User & {
    getDetails(user:string):void
}
```
Now admin has fields of both User and Admin

==But key difference is two types of same name cannot exist==
