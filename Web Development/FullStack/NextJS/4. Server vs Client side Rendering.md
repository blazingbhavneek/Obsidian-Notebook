# Server component
- Default setting of a component unless mentioned otherwise
- Rendering occurs on server, then streamed to the user. As only parts which are needed are streamed to the user it increases the loading speed as the whole website doesn't need to be downloaded at once
- Secure, handles data fetching etc on the server side itself hence protecting the sensitive logic of application
- **Caching**: By rendering on the server, the result can be cached and reused on subsequent requests and across users
- **Performance**: Server Components give you additional tools to optimize performance from the baseline. For example, if you start with an app composed of entirely Client Components, moving non-interactive pieces of your UI to Server Components can reduce the amount of client-side JavaScript needed
- **Initial Page Load and [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/fcp/)**: On the server, we can generate HTML to allow users to view the page immediately, without waiting for the client to download, parse and execute the JavaScript needed to render the page
- SEO friendly

# Client components
- **Interactivity**: Client Components can use state, effects, and event listeners, meaning they can provide immediate feedback to the user and update the UI.
- **Browser APIs**: Client Components have access to browser APIs, like [geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) or [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).
- Use `'use client';` on top of component file to set as client component
- An easy check is just write a `console.log` statement and if you can see it in browser console then its a client component, also server component give error if you write an `alert("")` statement
