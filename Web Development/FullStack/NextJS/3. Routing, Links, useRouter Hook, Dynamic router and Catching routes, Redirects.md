- Routing is like making map of the website like which "route" will take you to which page

# Basic
- Very easy, just create a folder in the app directory with the name of the route you want
- and in that folder just make sure there is a page.js and it will automatically create a route for you with that name
- The component returned by that page.js can be of any name

# Nested Routing
- same procedure as above, just create another folder inside the parent route and make sure that has a page.js
# Linking
- Links are component provided by NextJs to navigate between above defined page
- Used for ==Client side navigation==, which means it prevents the browser from refreshing and fetches new page's content on the client side itself, thus making it faster
- Used in the components JSX code itself

For globally used components, make a directory in the root folder name "components" and create a navbar.js file

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Link from 'next/link'

const Navbar = () => {
  return (
    <div>
        <div className="logo">
            <h1>Logo</h1>
        </div>
        <div className="link-container">
            <Link href='/'>Home</Link>
            <Link href='/about'>About</Link>
        </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Navbar
```
> Start using rafce
> Importing Link from next/link (just type Link and it'll autocomplete)
> Link component is predefined and its takes href just like html

## Note
layout.js in app directory
```jsx

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body
        className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}
      >
        <Navbar></Navbar>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

```
> Take note that Navbar is present above the {children} variable, the {children} variable is where Next starts to render the pages in routes


# useRouter Hook
Using the page routing functionality in other components using above hook

Lets create a button which takes us to about page
app/page.js
```jsx
"use client";

import React from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

const Home = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home</h1>
      <button onClick = {()=>router.push('about')}>Go to about page</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Home
```

# Ignoring a route
If you don't want a folder to be in path of a route, just wrap name of the folder in ()
Example:
(auth)
	Register
	Login

Its route will be /Login and /Register only

# Dynamic Router
Feature of NextJs that allows you to create webpage 
 - with variable and dynamic part in the url by creating a ==route pattern== 
 - they have a template but with different information and url based on some parameter (for example, routes like "/username1", "/username2")
Handcoding username based routes is impossible so we can automate it in NextJs

Folder structure of dynamic route (template which will be used for dynamic page generation)
- User
	- [user]
		- page.js

User/[user]/page.js
```jsx
"use client";

import React from 'react'

const User = ({params}) => {
    console.log(params)
  return (
    <div>
        <h1>User info of {params.user}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

export default User
```

# Catching all routes

Getting all information from URL that is given and using it in the page
For example (http://localhost:3000/Users/Bhavneek/Orders/jsnfakjdnsf/Details/dfafadfa)
We want:

Bhavneek
Orders
jsnfakjdnsf
Details
dfafadfa

For that we need the folder Structure

- app
	- User
		- [...all]
			- page.js

page.js
```jsx
import React from 'react'

const All = ({params}) => {
  return (
    <div>
        <br></br>
        {params.all.map((p)=>{
            return <h1 key={p}>{p}</h1>;
        })}
    </div>
  )
}

export default All
```

# 404 Not Found
Along with page.js just make a file named ==not-found.js== and then you can customize the 404 not found page

# Redirect
```jsx

import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

redirect("url")
```
URL can be a route of the current website or an external link
