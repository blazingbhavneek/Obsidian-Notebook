# Why we need states?
Look at the code below
App.js
```jsx
function App() {
  var age = 0;

  const increaseAge = () => {
    age = age+1;
    console.log(age);
  }
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {age}
      <button onClick={increaseAge} >Increase age</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Clicking the button should change the {age} in the JSX right? as its just a variable defined above, but NOOOO. It doesn't work like that, although the button is change the variable itself its not rendered by react in the JSX

Here's when states come in...
# States and useState

First import useState
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
```

Format of useState function
```jsx
let [variable, variable_setter_function] = useState(initial_vale);
```
it returns a variable that is tracked and a setter function that can change the tracked variable, can be initialised with a given value

An example
App.js
```jsx
function App() {

  let [age, setAge] = useState(0);
  const increaseAge = () => {
    setAge(age+1);
  }
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {age}
      <button onClick={increaseAge}>Increase age</button>
    </div>
  );
}

```
> You have to wrap the setAge in another function as onClick event only takes a function without arguement, react gives a warning there

Now, here the button click event is linear, there is only one thing you can do with it, but what if its a text box? and you want to grab the text from the input box from the function that wraps the set function? Managing div ids would be difficult task, so you can use...

## Events
The function that wraps set functions can take an arguement called event (not passed while writing that function in JSX), example
```jsx
const handleInputChange = (event) => {
	console.log(event.target.value)
}
```
now this will print the value of input box from where the event generated, the input box will look like this

```jsx
<input type="text" onChange={handleInputChange} />
```
