- Next.js is an open-source JavaScript framework that is built on top of React, popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
- It is designed to make it easier to create server-rendered React applications with a focus on developer productivity, performance, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
- Next.js provides a set of tools and conventions that simplify various aspects of building web applications.

# Features

- Server-side rendering (SSR): Next.js allows you to render React components on the server side before sending them to the client. This can improve page load times and SEO, as search engines can easily index the content. 
- Static site generation (SSG): Next.js also supports static site generation, where you can pre-render pages at build time. This approach is great for content-heavy websites and can offer even better performance and SEO benefits. 
- API routes: It offers a built-in API route feature that allows you to create serverless API endpoints within your Next.js project, making it easy to handle backend logic.
