## Compiling, Linking and Building
Building = CPP File -> Compiled into .obj files -> All obj files are linked into an executable
> Before linking, we need a declaration of existence when we use a function from another files, mainly done by header files (.hpp), but you can just declare a function to use it directly. If you don't you will get a linking error. The linked function declaration should be exact as the implementation (return types, name and params) else it might give a linking error

==Turn on compiler optimisations for faster code, by defaults it doesn't optimize for easy debugging==
## Preprocessor
Preproc statement start with # (eg, #include ), it runs before compiling and adding content from other files to current cpp file exactly where you wrote the # line.
- #include 
- #define
- #pragma 
- #if
If we enable preprocessing in project settings, we can see final file after preprocessors of extension .i

> `#pragma once` is used in header files, to avoid re-declaration if accidentally a header file is called twice somehow in a include 

Preproc statements with <> are in the include folder, whereas "" is used for other files in same folder (although "" will work for include files as well)

# Pointers and References

## Pointers
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    int var=10;
    void * ptr = &var;
    std::cout<<ptr<<std::endl;
    std::cin.get();
}
```

A pointer is just a memory location, it doesnt have a type, we just define its type to make it easy for us to read it.
Although it will give compiler error while using it de-referencing (the code will still run though)
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    int var=10;
    void * ptr = &var;
    std::cout << *ptr << std::endl;
    std::cin.get();
}
```
Because for the compiler we are passing a null value to std::cout

A small program to allocate 8 bytes from a given pointer then setting it all to 0
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    char* buffer = new char[8];
    memset(buffer, 0, 8);
    std::cin.get();
}
```

## References
References can't be null as there has to be something to refer in the first place. 
Reference of a variable returns a pointer.
A reference variable assigned to another variable is just an alias to actual variable.
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    int a=0;
    int& ref = a;
    ref=2;
    std::cout<<ref;
    std::cin.get();
}
```

> Passing a variable to function without reference makes a copy of the variable and then makes the changes, but doesn't changes the original

# Enums
Just grouping of variables to a umbrella variable to syntactically beautify code and make it easy to read
```cpp
#include <iostream>

enum StatusCode
{
    ERROR = 404, FINE = 200
};

int main(){
    StatusCode newCode = ERROR;
    std::cout<<newCode;
    std::cin.get();
}
```
# Constructors and Destructors
> If you want to only use static methods of class and not want to instantiate objects of the class then make the constructor private

Destructors are ran when object goes out of scope and cant be accessed anymore, or called when `delete obj;` is called

# Inheritance, Interfaces and Virtual functions
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Entity{
    public:
        float x, y;
        void Move(float xa, float ya){
            x+=xa;
            y+=ya;
        }

        std::string getName(){
            return "Entity";
        }
};

class Player: public Entity
{
    public:
        std::string name;

        Player(std::string inp){
            name=inp;
        }

        std::string getName(){
            return name;
        }
};

int main(){
    std::string s = "Bhavneek";
    Player* p1 = new Player(s);
    Entity* e1 = p1;
    std::cout<<e1->getName();
    std::cin.get();
}
```

>This code gives output "Entity"

Reason is even though the actual object is a Player object but CPP treats it like an entity because e1 obj was declared an Entity object, this causes confusion because as Player is inherited class every Player element is technically an Entity (but Entity objects are not Players)

> To fix this we add `virtual` keyword in the method of base class

```cpp
virtual std::string getName(){
```

## Interfaces
Now if i make the virtual function "pure", i.e
```cpp
class Entity{
    public:
        virtual std::string getName()=0;
};
```

Then the class will become an interface, because an object cannot be instantiated from this but a child class which inherits and implements the function can be instantiated

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

class Entity{
    public:
        virtual std::string getName()=0;
};

class Player: public Entity
{
    public:
        std::string name;

        Player(std::string inp){
            name=inp;
        }

        std::string getName() override{
            return name;
        }
};

int main(){
    std::string s = "Bhavneek";
    // Entity* e1 = new Entity();
    Player* p1 = new Player(s);
    std::cout<<p1->getName();
    std::cin.get();
}
```

==This is particularly useful when you want to make a few classes that follow a certain criteria that needs to be fulfilled in order to be passed in some methods that needs those fields/methods implemented ==
