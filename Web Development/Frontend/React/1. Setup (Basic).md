## Initial

Inside terminal (make sure node and npm is installed)
`npx create-react-app name-of-project`

Make sure app is running, in terminal of project folder
`npm start` and it will go to browser

## Where is what now

in App.js, our main app resides as this function
```
function App() {

	return (
	
		<div className="App">
		
		</div>
	
	);

}
```
`
it gets its style from App.css and is exported at the end of file

Then our above app is rendered by React DOM in index.js
```
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

root.render(

<React.StrictMode>

<App />

</React.StrictMode>

);
```
