## Const Keyword
Easy usage: once a variable declared with const, it cannot be changed later

Some work-arounds:
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

int main()
{
    const int max = 100;
    const int * a = new int;
    *a = 2; // won't work
    a = (int *) &max; // will work
    std::cout<< (*a) <<std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

int main()
{
    const int max = 100;
    int * const a = new int;
    *a = 2; // will work
    a = (int *) &max; // won't work
    std::cout<< (*a) <<std::endl; 
    return 0;
}
```

### Const in classes
```cpp
class Entity{
    private:
        int * x, y;
    public:
        int * getx() const{ // it means this method is not changing state of class
            return x;
        }
        
        const int * const gety() const{ // this means this method is not changing state of class and is returning a pointer whose address cannot be changed nor its contents.
            return y;
        }
}

```

### Const in function args
> sending const in functions as args means you cant do methods on them which are not defined const in the first place, as the const keyword in args guarantees that it wont be changed when sent.

## Mutable keyword
Adding mutable keyword infront of a variable can be changed anywhere, even in methods in that were defined const

## Member Initialiser list

```cpp
class Entity{
    private:
        int a; char b;
    public:
        Entity()
            : a(1), b('c') // this
        {}
        
        Entity(int av, char bv)
	        : a(av), b(bv) // and this
        {}
};

```

> We need this because using constructors in old way (declaring in private and setting them in constructor) creates the object two time, so its a memory overhead, with this it only does this one time.

## Ternary Operator
```cpp
variable = bool_returning_expression ? value_if_true : value_if_false
```

## New Keyword
Initiates an object or an array of objects in the heap
> Once work with the object is over, delete and free the memory with `delete obj_name`

## Implicit conversion and Explicit keyword
> If a class has constructor for just field alone (say int, other will go with some default value), then you can instantiate a class with `Class_name a = 2;` or `Class_name a(2);` this means cpp can implicitly convert this int (or other data types based on the field) to the object if required
> example: if a function requires an object of Class_name and it has a constructor that needs only say one int to initialise, then we can just pass an int to the function and it will automatically instantiate an object with that int.
## Explicit keyword
==If this keyword is added to constructor, then implicit conversion wont happen and constructor would need to be called explicitly==

## Operator Overloading
```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Vec2 {
    float x, y;

    Vec2 operator+(const Vec2& other) const {
        return {x + other.x, y + other.y};
    }

    float operator*(const Vec2& other) const { // Dot product
        return x * other.x + y * other.y;
    }
};

int main() {
    Vec2 v1 = {3, 4};
    Vec2 v2 = {1, 2};

    Vec2 sum = v1 + v2;
    float dot = v1 * v2;

    std::cout << "Sum: (" << sum.x << ", " << sum.y << ")\n";
    std::cout << "Dot Product: " << dot << "\n";

    return 0;
}

```

## This keyword
A pointer to current instantiated object which is accessed inside the class definition, using `this` keyword you can use static methods (defined outside the class which takes the class as an argument) inside the class itself.
