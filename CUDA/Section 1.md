- CPU vs GPU architecture
	- DRAM
	- ALU in CPUs, limited
	- ALUs in GPU, A lot of them, called cores
	-  Control and Caches
	- Small cache per core in gpu, large cache for ALUs in cpu, good for sequential
	- CPU ALU are for general sequential, but for GPU ALU the Cycles are less (1.2GHz as compared to 3-4GHz in cpu), but because of sheer number of alus parallel ops are hyper fast
- Sequential vs Non sequential instructions
- PCI Interfaces of CPU
	- PCI connection of GPU to CPU
	- Both have their own seperate DRAM (GRAM? which is that?)
- General GPU Architecture
	- SM: Streaming multiprocessor
		- Cores: FP cores and INT cores
		- Shared cache, L1 cache
		- Registers,  schedulers and dispatcher
		- Loaders and storers?
	- Global memory
	- Scheduler and dispatchers
	- L2 cache memory
- Architecture whitepapers
- Nvidia Categories and Generations
	- Architecture (for implementation details)
		- underlying struct and design of GPU 
		- Determines efficiency performance and  capabilities
		- Named after scientists
		- Turing one introduces ray tracing and tensor cores? Fact check this
	- Categories/Generations (for usage)
		- Standard: RTX XXXX
			- Generations
				- Tegra
				- GeForce
				- Quadro
		- HPCs: A100, H100
			- Gens
				- Tesla
		- Difference between diff generations
			- Tegra: For mobile devices
			- Geforce: For gamers, video editors, general consumers (RTX 3090)
			- Quadro: Professionals, engineers etc (RTX A4000, RTX AA6000)
			- Tesla: For HPCs (A100, H100)
	- techpowerup website to know specs of any gpu
- Difference betweeen GPU chip and GPU
	- The chip is the actual silicon core which contains cores 
	- The GPU itself contains the chip, memory and peripheral interfaces
- Architecture chips
	- Each architectures have their series of chips that are used in diff generations of GPU
	- GA series of chips are for ampere architecture
