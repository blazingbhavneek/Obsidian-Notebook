## Arrays
> While dealing with arrays, take care of out of bounds error because in debug mode you will get error but in release mode you will get access to memory location array\[-1] and you might change it to something which might make the program break
> 
```cpp
#include<iostream>

int main()
{
    int a[5]; // declaration to occupy memory for 5 integers
    int * arr = a; // pointer to first int element
    * (arr + 2) = 2; // cpp knows the pointer is for int, so ptr + 2 will move 32*2 bits ahead (or 4 bytes ahead two times)
    std::cout<<arr[2];
    return 0;
}

```

### Stack vs. Heap Arrays

#### Stack Arrays

**Declaration:**

```cpp
int arr[10];  // Fixed-size array on stack
int size = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
```

**Characteristics:**

- Allocated automatically within a function scope.
- Fixed size (must be known at compile time).
- Fast allocation/deallocation.
- Limited by stack size (~1MB-8MB in most systems).

**Use Cases:**

- When size is small and known at compile time.
- When you need fast access without memory management overhead.

---

#### **Heap Arrays**

**Declaration:**

```cpp
int * arr = new int[10];  // Dynamic allocation
// Above size trick wont work here as the size of the pointer is 4 bytes
// To maintain size, wrap this pointer in a class and maintain size integer there
```

**Characteristics:**

- Allocated using `new` or `malloc`.
- Can be resized (`std::vector` preferred for this).
- Slower allocation/deallocation.
- Must be manually freed (`delete[] arr;`).

**Use Cases:**

- When size is unknown at compile time.
- When large memory allocation is required.
- When data needs to persist beyond function scope.

---

Best Practices:

- Use **stack** whenever possible for efficiency.
- Prefer **`std::vector<int>`** over raw heap arrays for safety.
- Always free heap memory to avoid leaks.

Example
```cpp
#include<iostream>

class Arr{
public:
    int arr[5];
    
    Arr(){
        for(int i=0; i<5; i++){
            arr[i]=1;
        }
    }
};

int main()
{
    Arr a;
    std::cout<<a.arr[0]<<std::endl;
    return 0;
}

```

Going to memory location of Arr we will find the array
In contrast to
```cpp
#include<iostream>

class Arr{
public:
    int * arr = new int[5];
    
    Arr(){
        for(int i=0; i<5; i++){
            arr[i]=1;
        }
    }
};

int main()
{
    Arr a;
    std::cout<<a.arr[0]<<std::endl;
    return 0;
}

```
Going to memory location of Arr we will find the memory location of arr

### Array of dynamic size
```cpp
#include<iostream>

class Arr{
public:
    int * arr;
    
    Arr(int n){
        arr = new int[n];
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            arr[i]=1;
        }
    }
};

int main()
{
    Arr a = Arr(10);
    std::cout<<a.arr[0]<<std::endl;
    return 0;
}

```

## String
Defining a string without string library
```cpp
#include<iostream>

int main()
{
    const char * str = "Bhavneek";  // const not needed, but as string is immutable its convient to use const keyword for debugging
    std::cout<<str<<std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
> Notice str is a char pointer but we can still print the whole string , unlike arrays where printing the pointer will only printing memory location value. But what cpp does is after allocating chars in array like manner, at the end it puts a '0' (null termination char) at the memory which tells the std::cout to stop printing.
> Whereas if we initated an char array like below
```cpp
#include<iostream>

int main()
{
    char str[4] = {'N', 'a', 'm', '\0'};
    std::cout<<str<<std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
> We will have to put last char \0 or else it wont know where the string is ending and might give an undefined error or behave unpredictably

#### String library
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

int main()
{
    std::string str = "Bhavneek";
    std::cout<<str.size()<<std::endl;
    std::cout<<str<<std::endl;
    
    bool contains = str.find("hav") != std::string::npos;
    std::cout<<contains<<std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## String Literal
String between "" is a string literal
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

int main()
{
    const char name[10]= "Bhav\0neek";
    std::cout<<name<<std::endl; //output: Bhav (because I passed a null termination character in between)
    return 0;
}
```

> String initiated by pointer and literal is immutable and is initialised in the read only memory section. So dont try to refernce str\[int] and then change it it will not do anything in release mode but will give error in debug mode. (so use const keyword)

### Library

Usage
```cpp
using namespace std::string_literals;
```
#### **1. String Literals (`"..."`)**  
A sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes (`"Hello"`) automatically gets a **null terminator (`\0`)**.

#### **2. Prefixes for String Literals**  
| Prefix | Description                                                           | Example                  |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `""`   | Regular string                                                        | `"Hello"`                |
| `L""`  | Wide string (`wchar_t[]`)                                             | `L"Hello"`               |
| `u""`  | UTF-16 string (`char16_t[]`)                                          | `u"Hello"`               |
| `U""`  | UTF-32 string (`char32_t[]`)                                          | `U"Hello"`               |
| `R""`  | Raw string (ignores escape sequences,<br>make it easy for paragraphs) | R"(Hello <br><br>World)" |
|        |                                                                       |                          |

#### **3. `std::string` Operations**  
```cpp
std::string str = "Hello";
std::string result = str + " World";  // Concatenation
```

#### **4. `operator""s` (C++14)**  
- Allows `"..."s` to create `std::string` directly.  
```cpp
using namespace std::string_literals;
std::string str = "Hello"s;  // Equivalent to std::string("Hello")
```

#### **5. Appending with `+` Operator**  
```cpp
std::string full = "Hello"s + " World";
```  
(`+` does **not** work directly between `std::string` and `char[]` unless `"..."s` is used.)

==Pass the String as refernce in function or else a copy would be made==
## Const Keyword
Easy usage: once a variable declared with const, it cannot be changed later

Some work-arounds:
```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

int main()
{
    const int max = 100;
    const int * a = new int;
    *a = 2; // won't work
    a = (int *) &max; // will work
    std::cout<< (*a) <<std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<string>

int main()
{
    const int max = 100;
    int * const a = new int;
    *a = 2; // will work
    a = (int *) &max; // won't work
    std::cout<< (*a) <<std::endl; 
    return 0;
}
```

### Const in classes
```cpp
class Entity{
    private:
        int * x, y;
    public:
        int * getx() const{ // it means this method is not changing state of class
            return x;
        }
        
        const int * const gety() const{ // this means this method is not changing state of class and is returning a pointer whose address cannot be changed nor its contents.
            return y;
        }
}

```

### Const in function args
> sending const in functions as args means you cant do methods on them which are not defined const in the first place, as the const keyword in args guarantees that it wont be changed when sent.

## Mutable keyword
Adding mutable keyword infront of a variable can be changed anywhere, even in methods in that were defined const

## Member Initialiser list

```cpp
class Entity{
    private:
        int a; char b;
    public:
        Entity()
            : a(1), b('c') // this
        {
        }
        
        Entity(int av, char bv){
            a=av; b=bv;
        }
};

```

> We need this because using costructors in old way (declaring in private and setting them in constructor) creates the object two time, so its a memory overhead, with this it only does this one time.
