### Sharding in MongoDB

#### **What is Sharding?**
Sharding is like dividing a **big library into smaller sections** and storing each section in a different room. This makes it faster to find a book because you only search the relevant room. In MongoDB, sharding splits a large database into smaller chunks (called **shards**) and stores them across multiple servers. This helps manage huge amounts of data and speeds up queries.

---

### **Why Use Sharding?**
Imagine your app has **millions of users** or **billions of records**. A single server might get overloaded. Sharding solves this by:
- **Scaling horizontally**: Add more servers (shards) instead of upgrading one expensive server.
- **Improving performance**: Queries run faster because they only search a subset of data.
- **Handling growth**: Easily add more shards as your data grows.

---

### **Key Components of Sharding**
1. **Shards**:  
   - Individual servers (or clusters) that store a portion of the data.  
   - Example: If you split a `users` collection by country, one shard holds "USA" users, another holds "India" users, etc.

2. **Config Servers**:  
   - Store the "map" of which data is in which shard.  
   - Example: Like a library catalog that tells you which room has "Science Fiction" books.

3. **Mongos (Router)**:  
   - Directs your queries to the correct shard.  
   - Example: When you search for a user, `mongos` checks the config servers to find where that user’s data lives.

---

### **How Sharding Works (Step-by-Step)**

#### 1. Choose a **Shard Key**  
- The shard key is a field in your collection used to split data (e.g., `country`, `user_id`).  
- **Example**: If you shard a `users` collection by `country`, all users from "USA" go to Shard 1, "India" to Shard 2, etc.

#### 2. Split Data into Chunks  
- MongoDB divides data into **chunks** (smaller pieces) based on the shard key.  
- Example: If your shard key is `user_id`, chunks might look like:  
  - Chunk 1: `user_id: 1-1000` → Shard 1  
  - Chunk 2: `user_id: 1001-2000` → Shard 2  

#### 3. Query Routing via `mongos`  
- When you query data, `mongos` uses the shard key to send the query to the correct shard.  
- **Example**: If you search for `user_id: 1500`, `mongos` sends the query to Shard 2.

---

### **Example: Sharding a "Products" Collection**
Let’s say you have an e-commerce app with a `products` collection.  
1. **Shard Key**: `product_category` (e.g., "electronics", "clothing").  
2. **Shards**:  
   - Shard 1: Stores all "electronics" products.  
   - Shard 2: Stores all "clothing" products.  
3. **Query**: When someone searches for "laptops", `mongos` sends the query only to Shard 1.

---

### **Types of Sharding**
1. **Ranged Sharding**:  
   - Splits data into ranges (e.g., `user_id: 1-1000`, `1001-2000`).  
   - Good for range-based queries (e.g., "find users created between Jan-Feb").  

2. **Hashed Sharding**:  
   - Uses a hash function to randomly distribute data.  
   - Good for evenly spreading data (e.g., `user_id` hashed to random shards).  

3. **Zoned Sharding**:  
   - Custom rules to group data (e.g., "store all EU users in Shard 1").  

---

### **When to Use Sharding**
- Your database is too large for a single server (e.g., 500+ GB).  
- You need faster read/write speeds for massive data.  
- You expect rapid data growth (e.g., social media apps, IoT sensors).

---

### **Benefits of Sharding**
- **Scalability**: Add more shards as your data grows.  
- **Performance**: Parallel processing across shards speeds up queries.  
- **High Availability**: If one shard fails, others keep working.

---

### **Challenges**
- **Choosing the right shard key**: A bad key can lead to uneven data distribution.  
- **Complex setup**: Requires planning and monitoring.  
- **No joins across shards**: Queries are limited to a single shard.


---

### **Step 1: Setup Sharded Cluster**
Assume you have a standalone MongoDB server with the `ecomm.products` collection.  
First, set up a **sharded cluster** with 2 shards, 1 config server, and 1 `mongos` router.

#### **1.1 Start Config Server**
```bash
# Start config server (stores metadata about shards)
mongod --configsvr --dbpath /data/configdb --port 27019
```

#### **1.2 Start Shard Servers**
```bash
# Start Shard 1
mongod --shardsvr --dbpath /data/shard1 --port 27017

# Start Shard 2
mongod --shardsvr --dbpath /data/shard2 --port 27018
```

#### **1.3 Start `mongos` Router**
```bash
# Connect to config server
mongos --configdb localhost:27019 --port 27020
```

---

### **Step 2: Connect to `mongos` and Configure Sharding**
#### **2.1 Add Shards to the Cluster**
```bash
# Connect to mongos
mongo --port 27020

# Add Shard 1
sh.addShard("localhost:27017")

# Add Shard 2
sh.addShard("localhost:27018")
```

#### **2.2 Enable Sharding for `ecomm` Database**
```js
sh.enableSharding("ecomm")
```

#### **2.3 Shard the `products` Collection**
Choose a **shard key** (e.g., `category` field).  
First, create an index on the shard key:
```js
use ecomm
db.products.createIndex({ category: 1 })
```

Now shard the collection:
```js
sh.shardCollection("ecomm.products", { category: 1 })
```

---

### **Step 3: Insert Sample Data**
```js
// Insert sample products
db.products.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: "Laptop", category: "electronics", price: 1000 },
  { _id: 2, name: "T-Shirt", category: "clothing", price: 20 },
  { _id: 3, name: "Smartphone", category: "electronics", price: 800 },
  { _id: 4, name: "Jeans", category: "clothing", price: 50 }
])
```

---

### **Step 4: Querying Sharded Data**
#### **4.1 Basic Query via `mongos`**
```js
// Find all electronics products
db.products.find({ category: "electronics" })
```
Output:
```js
{ _id: 1, name: "Laptop", category: "electronics", price: 1000 }
{ _id: 3, name: "Smartphone", category: "electronics", price: 800 }
```

The `mongos` router will direct this query **only to the shard(s)** containing `category: "electronics"`.

---

#### **4.2 Check Which Shard Stores the Data**
Use `explain()` to see which shard was queried:
```js
db.products.find({ category: "electronics" }).explain("executionStats")
```
Look for the `shards` field in the output:
```js
"shards" : {
  "shard1" : [ ... ],  // Electronics data may be here
  "shard2" : [ ... ]
}
```

---

#### **4.3 Insert Data and Verify Distribution**
Insert more data:
```js
db.products.insertMany([
  { _id: 5, name: "Headphones", category: "electronics", price: 100 },
  { _id: 6, name: "Sweater", category: "clothing", price: 40 }
])
```

Check data distribution across shards:
```js
sh.status()
```
Output:
```
--- Sharding Status ---
  shards:
    {  "_id": "shard1", "host": "localhost:27017" }
    {  "_id": "shard2", "host": "localhost:27018" }

databases:
  {  "_id": "ecomm", "primary": "shard1", "partitioned": true }

ecomm.products
  shard key: { "category": 1 }
  chunks:
    shard1: 2
    shard2: 1
```

---

### **Step 5: Add a New Shard**
If data grows, add a new shard dynamically:
```js
// Start Shard 3 on port 27021
mongod --shardsvr --dbpath /data/shard3 --port 27021

// Add to cluster
sh.addShard("localhost:27021")
```

MongoDB will automatically rebalance data across all shards.

---

### **Key Notes for Beginners**
1. **Shard Key Choice**:  
   - Pick a field with **high cardinality** (e.g., `category` in this example).  
   - Avoid fields that change frequently (e.g., `price`).

2. **Query Isolation**:  
   - Queries **without the shard key** will run on **all shards** (slow!).  
   Example: `db.products.find({ price: { $gt: 100 } })` → "scatter-gather" query.

3. **Balancing**:  
   - MongoDB automatically balances chunks between shards.  
   - Use `sh.status()` to monitor distribution.

---

### **Summary of Commands**
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sh.addShard("host:port")` | Add a shard to the cluster |
| `sh.enableSharding("db")` | Enable sharding for a database |
| `sh.shardCollection("db.collection", { key: 1 })` | Shard a collection |
| `sh.status()` | Check shard distribution |

### **Hashed Sharding**

Hashed sharding is a strategy to **evenly distribute data** across shards using a **hash function** on the shard key. Unlike ranged sharding (which groups data in ranges like `1-100`, `101-200`), hashed sharding **randomizes** the distribution, preventing hotspots and ensuring balanced data storage. It’s ideal for workloads with high write volumes or when the shard key has low cardinality (e.g., monotonically increasing fields like timestamps).

---

### **How Hashed Sharding Works**
1. **Hash Function**: MongoDB converts the shard key value into a hash (a random-looking number).
2. **Chunk Distribution**: Data is split into chunks based on the hash value range (e.g., `-2^63` to `2^63`).
3. **Balanced Shards**: MongoDB automatically distributes chunks evenly across shards.

---

### **Example: Sharding `ecomm.products` with a Hashed Key**
Let’s shard the `products` collection using a hashed shard key on `_id` (a common choice for even distribution).

#### **Step 1: Set Up the Sharded Cluster**
Follow the same setup as before (config server, shards, and `mongos` router). Skip this step if you already have a cluster.

#### **Step 2: Enable Sharding and Shard the Collection**
```js
// Connect to mongos router
mongo --port 27020

// Enable sharding for the database
sh.enableSharding("ecomm")

// Create a hashed index on `_id` (required for sharding)
use ecomm
db.products.createIndex({ _id: "hashed" })

// Shard the collection using the hashed key
sh.shardCollection("ecomm.products", { _id: "hashed" })
```

---

#### **Step 3: Insert Sample Data**
```js
// Insert 10,000 sample products (for realistic distribution)
for (let i = 1; i <= 10000; i++) {
  db.products.insert({
    _id: i,
    name: `Product ${i}`,
    category: ["electronics", "clothing", "books"][i % 3],
    price: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000)
  })
}
```

---

#### **Step 4: Check Data Distribution**
Run `sh.status()` to see how chunks are distributed:
```js
sh.status()

// Output snippet:
// ...
// ecomm.products
//   shard key: { "_id" : "hashed" }
//   chunks:
//     shard1: 3
//     shard2: 3
//     shard3: 2
```
MongoDB automatically balances chunks across shards as data grows.

---

### **Querying with Hashed Sharding**
#### **Example 1: Query by Shard Key (`_id`)**
```js
// Find product with _id: 500 (directed to a single shard)
db.products.find({ _id: 500 })
```
- The `mongos` router calculates the hash of `_id: 500` and sends the query to the shard holding that chunk.
- **Fast**: Only one shard is queried.

---

#### **Example 2: Query Without Shard Key**
```js
// Find all products in "electronics" category (scatter-gather query)
db.products.find({ category: "electronics" })
```
- The query is sent to **all shards** because `category` is not the shard key.
- **Slower**: Results are gathered from multiple shards.

---

### **Pros and Cons of Hashed Sharding**
| **Pros**                                  | **Cons**                                  |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Even data distribution (no hotspots).     | Range queries are inefficient.            |
| Works well for high write throughput.     | Requires exact shard key for fast queries.|
| Good for monotonically increasing keys (e.g., `_id`, timestamps). | Shard key cannot be changed. |

---

### **When to Use Hashed Sharding**
1. **High write throughput**: For apps like IoT sensors, logging systems, or social media feeds.
2. **Uniform distribution**: When you want to avoid hotspots (e.g., sharding on `user_id` in a social media app).
3. **Non-range-based queries**: When most queries fetch single documents (e.g., `findByUserId`).

---

### **Real-World Example: IoT Sensor Data**
Imagine a collection of sensor readings with `sensor_id` as the shard key:
```js
// Shard the collection
sh.shardCollection("iot.sensors", { sensor_id: "hashed" })

// Insert data
db.sensors.insertMany([
  { sensor_id: "sensor_1", timestamp: ISODate(), value: 25 },
  { sensor_id: "sensor_2", timestamp: ISODate(), value: 30 }
])
```
- Data from `sensor_1` and `sensor_2` will be distributed randomly across shards.
- Queries for a specific sensor (`sensor_id: "sensor_1"`) are fast and isolated to one shard.

---

### **Key Commands for Hashed Sharding**
1. Create a hashed index:
   ```js
   db.collection.createIndex({ field: "hashed" })
   ```
2. Shard the collection:
   ```js
   sh.shardCollection("db.collection", { field: "hashed" })
   ```
3. Check chunk distribution:
   ```js
   sh.status()
   ```

### **What to Study Next**
1. **Zoned Sharding**: Combine hashed sharding with geographic zones (e.g., store EU data in EU shards).
2. **Performance Tuning**: Use `explain("executionStats")` to analyze query routing.
3. **Replica Sets + Sharding**: Deploy each shard as a replica set for high availability.
