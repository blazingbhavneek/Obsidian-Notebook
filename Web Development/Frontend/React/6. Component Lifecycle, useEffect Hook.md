# Terminology
In a component lifecycle
1. Mounting: When comp appears on screen
2. Updating: When some state changes in a component
3. Unmounting: When its removed from the screen

Now these stages of component lifecycle is used by useEffect hook


>Note: Running useEffect hook in main App component consoles the message twice if the app is running in strict as Strict mode renders twice to check if useEffect hooks are used properly

App.js
```jsx
	useEffect(()=>{
	    console.log("Component mounted!")
	})
```
Index.js:  
```jsx
	<React.StrictMode>
	    <App />
	</React.StrictMode>
```
