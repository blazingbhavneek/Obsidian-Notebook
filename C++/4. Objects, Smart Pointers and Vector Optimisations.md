## Object lifetime
1. Object created on stack `Class_name obj;`
	1. Calls the destructor when it goes out of scope (if scope, function scope, or just brackets)
	2. One common mistake is making a Stack variable in a function and then returning its pointer
2. Object created on heap
	1. Have to delete manually by calling `delete obj`

## Smart Pointers

First, we have a class with a const and destr with cout
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory> // !!!!!!

class Entity{
    public:
        Entity(){
            std::cout<<"Entity Created!"<<std::endl;
        }
        
        ~Entity(){
            std::cout<<"Entity Destroyed!"<<std::endl;
        }
};

```
### Unique Pointers
> Creates object in the stack
> Reason its named unique because the pointer cannot be copied

```cpp
int main() {
    {
        std::unique_ptr<Entity> e = std::make_unique<Entity>();
        e->method_name();
    }
    return 0;
}

```
### Shared pointer, Reference counting and weak pointer
```cpp

int main() {
    std::shared_ptr<Entity> e2;
    {
        std::shared_ptr<Entity> e = std::make_shared<Entity>();
        e2 =e;
    }
    std::cin.get();
    return 0;
}

```
>You will observe here that even if shared ptr has scoped lifetime, if the pointer its shared with is defined out of the scope, it will survive. But the catch is its also storing a ==reference count== somewhere in the memory to count and call the destructor if the count goes to 0.

>If you want a pointer but dont want to increase ref count then you can make a weak pointer, it means  if its defines out of scope and the program goes out of scope then the object will be deleted.


##  Copying and Copy Constructors
First lets start with an Entity class
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

class Entity{
    public:
        int a, b;
        Entity(int x): a(x), b(x){}
};
```

### Copying the contents of object
```cpp
int main() {
    Entity x(1);
    Entity y = x;
    y.a = 2;
    std::cout<<x.a<<std::endl; // Output = 1
    return 0;
}
```

### Copying only memory location of the object
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

class Entity{
    public:
        int a, b;
        Entity(int x): a(x), b(x){}
};

int main() {
    Entity * x = new Entity(1);
    Entity * y = x;
    y->a = 2;
    std::cout<<x->a<<std::endl; // Output = 2
    return 0;
}

```

### Memory Leaks and Copy constructors
Now, combing above two concepts, a memory leak can be made, assume a Class has a pointer to some string lets say, and a copy is made of the an object. The copy would have copy of the pointer pointing to the same block of memory. If one of them gets deconstructed, this new pointer will point to unallocated memory. To fix this we need a deepcopy, so we will use a ==copy constructor==.

```cpp
Entity(const Entity& other) : normal_field(other.normal_field) 
{ 
	pointer_field = new char[size]; // or any other type
	memcpy(pointer_field, other.pointer_field, size); 
}
```

>==One more reason to pass objects by const and refernce because else there always will be copies of them floating around in the memory specially if a copy constructor is written as well==

## Vector of Objects vs Vector of Pointers
> Vector of Objects is better becaue while iterating they will be placed contigously and will be accessed easy in cache, else stack pointer in cpu have to get Object from where the pointer was storing the actual object.

==While using for(auto v: vector), use ref (and const) to avoid copying==

## Vector optimizations
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

struct MyType {
    int x;
    MyType(int val) : x(val) {}
    MyType(const MyType& other): x(other.x) 
    {
        std::cout << "Copied!" << std::endl; 
    }
};

int main() {
    std::vector<MyType> v;
    v.push_back(MyType(1));
    v.push_back(MyType(2));
    v.push_back(MyType(3));
	// "Copied!" Will be printed 6 TIMES!!!
    return 0;
}

```
> Every time MyType obj  is instantiated and moved to Vector in memory its copied once, and every time push_back is called it copies the other existing members and copies them to a new location, hence 6 copies total.

### Optimisation
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

struct MyType {
    int x;
    MyType(int val) : x(val) {}
    MyType(const MyType& other): x(other.x) 
    {
        std::cout << "Copied!" << std::endl; 
    }
};

int main() {
    std::vector<MyType> v;
    v.reserve(3); // Preallocate memory to avoid reallocations

    v.emplace_back(1); // Constructs in place, avoiding extra copy/move
    v.emplace_back(2);
    v.emplace_back(3);

    return 0;
}

```

"Copied!" printed 0 times!!!
