## 1. Buildtime vs Runtime

### What's the difference?

- **Buildtime**: When Docker is creating your image (during `docker build`)
- **Runtime**: When Docker is running your container (during `docker run`)

Think of it like cooking:

- **Buildtime** = Preparing ingredients and cooking the meal
- **Runtime** = Serving and eating the meal

## 2. Statement Types: Overwrite vs Additive

### Overwrite Statements

These replace any previous values completely:

- **CMD**: Only the last CMD in your Dockerfile matters
- **WORKDIR**: Sets the current working directory, overwriting previous setting

### Additive Statements

These add to or accumulate previous values:

- **EXPOSE**: Each EXPOSE adds another port to the list
- **ENV**: Each ENV adds more environment variables (unless same key is used)

**Example:**

```dockerfile
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443
EXPOSE 8080
# Result: All three ports (80, 443, 8080) are exposed

CMD echo "first"
CMD echo "second"  
# Result: Only "second" will execute
```

## 3. Buildtime vs Runtime Statements

### Buildtime Statements (Execute during image creation)

- **COPY**: Copies files into the image
- **RUN**: Executes commands while building the image
- **ADD**: Similar to COPY but with extra features

### Runtime Statements (Execute when container starts)

- **CMD**: Defines the default command to run

### Both Buildtime and Runtime

- **ENV**: Sets environment variables that are available during build AND when container runs

**Example:**

```dockerfile
# Buildtime - happens during 'docker build'
COPY app.py /app/
RUN pip install flask

# Runtime - happens during 'docker run'  
CMD python /app/app.py

# Both - available during build and runtime
ENV PORT=8080
```

## 4. CMD vs ENTRYPOINT

### CMD (Command)

- Defines the default command to run when container starts
- **Can be overwritten** easily at runtime
- Acts as fallback/default behavior

### ENTRYPOINT

- Defines the main command that will ALWAYS run
- **Cannot be overwritten** (unless using `--entrypoint` flag)
- Makes your container behave like an executable

### How to check what's set:

```bash
docker inspect <image_name>
# Look for "Cmd" and "Entrypoint" in the output
```

## 5. Overwriting CMD at Runtime

You can replace CMD when running a container:

```dockerfile
# In Dockerfile
CMD echo "Hello World"
```

```bash
# This overwrites the CMD
docker run myimage echo "Different message"
# Output: "Different message" (not "Hello World")
```

## 6. ENTRYPOINT Cannot Be Overwritten

```dockerfile
# In Dockerfile  
ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
```

```bash
# This adds to ENTRYPOINT, doesn't replace it
docker run myimage "Hello"
# Output: "Hello" (echo + "Hello")

# To override ENTRYPOINT (rarely done):
docker run --entrypoint="" myimage /bin/bash
```

## 7. ENTRYPOINT + CMD Together

When both are defined, they work together: **ENTRYPOINT runs first, then CMD is appended as arguments**

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["curl"]
CMD ["--help"]
```

**Behavior:**

- Default run: `docker run myimage` → executes `curl --help`
- With arguments: `docker run myimage https://google.com` → executes `curl https://google.com`

## 8. Practical Example: Curl Container

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

# Option 1: Only CMD (not flexible)
CMD curl --help
# Usage: docker run myimage
# Problem: To curl a URL, you need: docker run myimage curl https://google.com

# Option 2: ENTRYPOINT + CMD (flexible)
ENTRYPOINT ["curl"]  
CMD ["--help"]
# Usage: docker run myimage                    → curl --help
# Usage: docker run myimage https://google.com → curl https://google.com
```

## 9. Container Startup Scripts Use Case

Common pattern for initialization:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["./startup.sh"]
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

The startup script runs first, then the main application.

## 10. ⚠️ Important Warning: PID 1 and Signal Handling

### The Problem

```dockerfile
# DON'T DO THIS
CMD ./startup.sh && python app.py
```

**Why this is bad:**

- The shell script becomes PID 1 (main process)
- Docker/Kubernetes termination signals go to the shell script
- Shell script might not handle signals properly
- Container won't shut down gracefully

### The Solution

```dockerfile
# DO THIS INSTEAD
ENTRYPOINT ["./startup.sh"]
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**In startup.sh:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Do initialization work here
echo "Starting up..."

# CRITICAL: Use exec to replace shell with the main app
exec "$@"
```

**Why this works:**

- Startup script runs initialization
- `exec "$@"` replaces the shell with your main app
- Your main app gets PID 1 and receives signals properly

## 11. Shell Form vs Exec Form

### Shell Form (String format)

```dockerfile
CMD echo "Hello World"
RUN apt-get update
```

- Simple string after the instruction
- Docker creates a shell (`/bin/sh -c`) to run the command
- Command runs as subprocess of the shell

### Exec Form (JSON array format)

```dockerfile
CMD ["echo", "Hello World"]
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
```

- JSON array format: `["command", "arg1", "arg2"]`
- Docker runs the command directly (no shell)
- Command gets PID 1

## 12. Which Instructions Use Which Form?

### Typically Shell Form:

- **RUN**: `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install curl`

### Typically Exec Form:

- **ENTRYPOINT**: `ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]`
- **CMD**: `CMD ["--help"]` (when used with ENTRYPOINT)

### Special Case: ENTRYPOINT Must Use Exec Form

If ENTRYPOINT uses shell form, CMD won't work as expected:

```dockerfile
# WRONG - CMD won't be passed as arguments
ENTRYPOINT python app.py  
CMD --debug

# CORRECT - CMD gets passed as arguments  
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
CMD ["--debug"]
```

## 13. The SHELL Instruction

```dockerfile
# Change default shell for RUN commands
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]

# Now this RUN uses bash instead of sh
RUN echo "Using bash now"
```

## 14. Process ID (PID) Implications

### Exec Form → PID 1

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]  
# python process gets PID 1
```

### Shell Form → Subprocess

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT python app.py
# sh process gets PID 1, python runs as subprocess
```

**Why PID 1 matters:**

- PID 1 receives system signals (SIGTERM, SIGKILL)
- Important for graceful container shutdown
- Kubernetes/Docker orchestration relies on proper signal handling
